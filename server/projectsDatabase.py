    'users': [user1, user2, ...]

Hardware-set stock (Track B) is superseded by hardwareDatabase's own
docstring: it now lives in the separate `HardwareSets` collection
(projectId + hwSetKey), not nested in this document. This document's
`users` list remains the source of truth for project membership; see
assertProjectMember below.
