  - test: "Run `npm --prefix client run dev` with a reachable Flask/MongoDB backend (seeded household `H1` with items in Pantry, Fridge, and Freezer). At 1200px, confirm each item card shows a visibly distinct colored left-edge stripe per location (Pantry/Fridge/Freezer), no column-header row is present, clicking an item's summary expands/collapses its batch list and actions, and clicking inside a Consume/Reserve control does NOT collapse the card."
    expected: "Cards render with distinct location stripes, disclosure toggle works, click-containment inside ItemActions holds."
    why_human: "Visual color distinctness and interactive click-behavior on a live DOM cannot be confirmed by static grep/AST checks; requires a rendered browser session (WINDOWS ledger #6, backend unreachable in the sandboxed executor worktree)."
  - test: "Narrow the viewport to 375px. Confirm the item summary fields stack vertically, batch cards stack their four labelled fields vertically, the Consume/Reserve label-input-button rows wrap instead of overflowing, and the page shows no horizontal scrollbar."
    expected: "No horizontal scroll; all fields stack per the 599px breakpoint CSS."
    why_human: "Layout reflow and absence of horizontal overflow is a rendered-viewport property, not inferable from source (WINDOWS ledger #8)."
  - test: "Tab through the Restock form and an expanded item card's Consume/Reserve/Release buttons. Confirm every focused control shows a visible brown focus ring (`--color-accent`), hovering a button darkens its border with a short fade and does not shift layout, and a disabled button (e.g. mid-submit) shows greyed text and a not-allowed cursor."
    expected: "Focus-visible ring, hover fade, and disabled state all render as designed, with no layout shift."
    why_human: "Focus-ring visibility, hover-fade smoothness, and 'reads as warm parchment not cool grey-blue' are perceptual judgments that require a rendered browser (WINDOWS ledger #7)."
  - test: "Expand an item with 2+ batches at 1200px and confirm batch order matches server response order (soonest best-by first for Pantry/Fridge, oldest purchase first for Freezer)."
    expected: "Batch order in the rendered card list matches the server's returned order."
    why_human: "Confirming rendered order against live server data requires a running backend with real batch data; grep can only confirm no `.sort()` call exists in the client (already confirmed: 0 matches)."

# Phase 5 (Track E): UI Design — Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Track B's inventory UI is visually coherent and usable on a phone, and Track A/Track C have a documented component contract to wire their own UI into instead of touching presentation internals.
**Verified:** 2026-09-24
**Status:** human_needed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths (mapped to ROADMAP Success Criteria)

| # | Truth (Success Criterion) | Status | Evidence |
|---|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | SC-1: Inventory view has clear visual grouping/spacing, not bare HTML tables, usable at phone width | ✓ VERIFIED (code-level) / needs human for rendered result | `client/src/components/Project.js` and `BatchList.js` contain zero `<table>`/`<thead>`/`<tbody>`/`colSpan` (grep confirms 0 in both files). `.item-card-list`/`.item-card`/`.batch-card-list`/`.batch-card` classes exist in `App.css` with a `@media (max-width: 599px)` block that stacks `.item-summary`, `.batch-card`, and `.item-actions__row`. Build succeeds. Rendered phone-width stacking and no-horizontal-scroll is a human-check item (see below). |
| 2 | SC-2: Freshness badges use consistent, recognizable color coding | ✓ VERIFIED | All four `.freshness-badge--{fresh,expiring_soon,expired,unknown}` rules in `App.css` resolve `background-color`/`color`/`border-color` from `var(--color-{state}-*)` tokens (verified by direct read — no hex literals remain, confirmed by `grep -oE '#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,8}' App.css` = 0). `FreshnessBadge.js` is otherwise untouched — its text label and `title` tooltip logic is unchanged, so color remains a reinforcing signal, not the sole one (WCAG 1.4.1 preserved). |
| 3 | SC-3: `InventoryView`'s session-identity props documented as a contract at one call site | ✓ VERIFIED | `Project.js` carries a JSDoc block above `InventoryView` documenting `householdId`/`userId`/`userName` (all "No fallback/default"). `App.js` has a one-line comment at the call site pointing to `05-DESIGN.md`. `05-DESIGN.md` has a dedicated `## InventoryView Session-Identity Contract` section with a props table. All three props match the real destructuring in `Project.js` line 113. |
| 4 | SC-4: Every presentational component's data-only prop contract documented | ✓ VERIFIED | All 7 component functions (`InventoryView`, `LocationSection`, `AmbiguityNotice`, `FreshnessBadge`, `BatchList`, `ItemActions`, `RestockForm`) carry a JSDoc block with `@component`, a `Data source:` marker, a `No hard-coded fallback:` line, and `@param` per prop — confirmed by direct read of all 5 source files and by `grep -rc '@component' / 'Data source:' / 'No hard-coded fallback:'` each summing to exactly 7. `05-DESIGN.md`'s `## Component Prop Contracts` section restates all 7 with a Fallback=`none` column for every prop (18+ rows). Prop names in the doc match the real destructuring patterns in source (spot-checked all 5 files). |
| 5 | SC-5: A small shared set of style tokens exists and is documented | ✓ VERIFIED | `client/src/index.css` declares a single `:root` block (confirmed `grep -c ':root'` = 1) with 53 custom properties (color, spacing, typography, radius, motion). `App.css` contains zero hex literals and consumes tokens exclusively (`var(--color-` = 43 refs, `var(--space-` = 39 refs). `05-DESIGN.md`'s `## Design Tokens` section documents every token declared in `index.css` with value and purpose — verified with a full coverage loop (`while read t; do grep -q -- "$t" DESIGN.md ...`) that printed zero `MISSING` lines. |

**Score:** 5/5 Success Criteria have complete code-level and documentation-level evidence. All are gated on a final human visual/perceptual pass before the phase can be marked "fully verified" in the sense the plans themselves anticipated (both plans' `human_verify_mode: end-of-phase` explicitly deferred these checks, and `05-VALIDATION.md` scoped all 5 SCs as manual-only from the start — there is no visual-regression tooling in this project, by design, for a PoC).

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `client/src/index.css` | `:root` design-token system | ✓ VERIFIED | 53 tokens across typography/spacing/radius/color/motion, single `:root` block, existing 3 declarations (font-family/color/background-color) now consume tokens |
| `client/src/App.css` | Tokenized styles + first responsive breakpoint + card selectors | ✓ VERIFIED | 0 hex literals, 2 `@media` blocks (599px + prefers-reduced-motion), `.item-card`/`.batch-card` families present, shared button interactive states (hover/focus-visible/disabled) present |
| `client/src/App.js` | Call-site comment pointing at `05-DESIGN.md` | ✓ VERIFIED | Line 17 comment present, `HOUSEHOLD_ID`/`USER_ID`/`USER_NAME` placeholders left untouched (correctly out of scope — tracked as WINDOWS #2, Track A/ACCT-04's responsibility) |
| `client/src/components/Project.js` | Card markup + JSDoc for `InventoryView`/`LocationSection`/`AmbiguityNotice` | ✓ VERIFIED | No `<table>`, disclosure/summary/BatchList/ItemActions nesting order unchanged, 3 JSDoc blocks present |
| `client/src/components/BatchList.js` | Card markup + JSDoc, render-order contract preserved | ✓ VERIFIED | No `<table>`, "MUST be rendered in the order it is received" preserved verbatim, `sort(` count = 0, JSDoc + `@param` tags present |
| `client/src/components/FreshnessBadge.js` | JSDoc above function signature, module-top prose preserved | ✓ VERIFIED | New block directly above `export default function FreshnessBadge`, original 1-11 prose block unmoved |
| `client/src/components/Checkout.js` | JSDoc conversion, dibs-not-lock framing preserved, stopPropagation preserved | ✓ VERIFIED | `//` header block converted to `/** */`, "never a lock" text intact, `stopPropagation` handler intact at the same nesting depth |
| `client/src/components/RestockForm.js` | JSDoc above function signature | ✓ VERIFIED | Block present, no markup changes (per scope) |
| `.planning/phases/05-ui-design/05-DESIGN.md` | Canonical token + prop-contract doc | ✓ VERIFIED | All 6 required headings present, 7/7 component sub-sections, token coverage loop clean, no credential leakage (0 matches for `mongodb+srv`/`SECRET_KEY`/`MONGO_URI`/password patterns) |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|----|--------|---------|
| `index.css` `:root` tokens | `App.css` `var(--*)` references | CSS custom property resolution | ✓ WIRED | Every `var(--...)` name referenced in `App.css` traced back to a declaration in `index.css` (spot-checked; plan's own acceptance-criteria loop for this was part of the executed task and the build — which resolves all CSS at build time — succeeded with no missing-property warnings) |
| `Project.js` `LocationSection` card wrapper | `<details>`/`<summary>` disclosure subtree | Verbatim nesting preservation | ✓ WIRED | Read directly: `<li className="item-card...">` wraps `<details className="item-disclosure">` → `<summary className="item-summary">` → `BatchList` → conditional `AmbiguityNotice` → `ItemActions`, in that exact order, unchanged from pre-restructure source |
| `Checkout.js` `ItemActions` root `stopPropagation` | Position as descendant of the same `<details>` | Unchanged component tree position | ✓ WIRED | `ItemActions` is still rendered as the last child of `<details>` in `LocationSection`; `onClick={(event) => event.stopPropagation()}` unchanged at `Checkout.js` line 114 |
| `App.js` call-site comment | `05-DESIGN.md` session-identity section | Doc cross-reference | ✓ WIRED | `App.js` line 17 comment references the exact file path; `05-DESIGN.md` has the matching `## InventoryView Session-Identity Contract` section |
| Each component's JSDoc `Data source:` marker | `05-DESIGN.md`'s per-component `Data source:` line | Cross-file consistency | ✓ WIRED | Tally of `Data source:` values matches between source (`props only` ×4, `fetches via...` ×1, `mutates via...` ×2) and `05-DESIGN.md` (confirmed identical distribution by direct read of both) |

### Behavioral Spot-Checks

| Behavior | Command | Result | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| Client builds without error after all Phase 5 changes | `npm --prefix client run build` | Exit 0, `dist/index.html` + CSS/JS bundles produced (7.74 kB CSS, 152 kB JS) | ✓ PASS |
| No `<table>` markup survives in restructured components | `grep -cE '<table\|</table>\|colSpan' Project.js` and `grep -cE '<table\|<thead\|<tbody' BatchList.js` | Both print `0` | ✓ PASS |
| No raw-HTML injection introduced (threat T-05-01) | `grep -rc 'dangerouslySetInnerHTML' client/src/` | No non-zero lines | ✓ PASS |
| All 7 components carry the 3 required JSDoc markers | `grep -rc '@component' \| 'Data source:' \| 'No hard-coded fallback:'` | 7 / 7 / 7 | ✓ PASS |
| Track B provenance paragraphs preserved verbatim | `grep -c 'MUST be rendered in the order it is received' BatchList.js`; `grep -c 'never a lock' Checkout.js` | 1 / 1 | ✓ PASS |
| No credential/connection-string leaked into `05-DESIGN.md` | `grep -rciE 'mongodb+srv\|password=\|SECRET_KEY\|MONGO_URI'` | 0 | ✓ PASS |
| Scope boundary respected (no data/API/server changes) | `git diff --stat` from phase start against `client/src/api/` and `server/` | Empty | ✓ PASS |
| No debt markers introduced | `grep -nE 'TBD\|FIXME\|XXX\|TODO\|HACK\|PLACEHOLDER'` across all 8 touched files | No matches | ✓ PASS |
| No stray "placeholder"/stub language introduced by this phase | case-insensitive grep across touched files | Only pre-existing `App.js` comment about `HOUSEHOLD_ID`/`USER_ID` (tracked separately as WINDOWS #2, explicitly out of scope and documented in `05-DESIGN.md`'s "What This Phase Did Not Change") | ✓ PASS (no new debt) |

*Full test-suite runs were not applicable — this project has zero client-side test framework (`05-VALIDATION.md` confirms this by design; not a Phase 5 gap).*

### Anti-Patterns Found

None. No `TBD`/`FIXME`/`XXX`/`TODO`/`HACK`/`PLACEHOLDER` markers, no empty-return stubs, no hardcoded-empty-data-flowing-to-render patterns, no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, no gradients/box-shadows (explicitly forbidden by the plan's own D-06 flat-hairline-border elevation language and confirmed absent by grep), no wildcard `transition: all`.

### Requirements Coverage

Phase 5 has no `REQUIREMENTS.md` IDs — board items use `DESIGN` in place of a requirement ID, consistent with `ROADMAP.md`'s framing of Track E as additive quality work. All 5 Success Criteria are addressed as detailed above.

### Human Verification Required

The code-level and documentation-level evidence for all 5 Success Criteria is complete and internally consistent (source ↔ `05-DESIGN.md` ↔ `App.css`/`index.css` all agree, and the build passes). What remains is exactly the class of check this project's own workflow scoped as manual-only from the start (`05-VALIDATION.md`: "All 5 criteria are visual/documentation checks with no meaningful automated assertion available... this phase's verification as manual UAT-driven"), and which both executors correctly deferred rather than skipped, recording each as an open `unrun-verify` entry in `.planning/WINDOWS.md` (#6, #7, #8) because the Flask/MongoDB backend was unreachable in their sandboxed worktrees.

1. **Visual card distinctness + disclosure/click-containment behavior** (WINDOWS #6)
   **Test:** Run the app against a live backend at 1200px viewport; confirm each location's cards show a visually distinct colored stripe, expand/collapse works, and clicking Consume/Reserve doesn't collapse the card.
   **Expected:** All hold true per the CSS/markup already in place.
   **Why human:** Perceptual color distinctness and interactive DOM behavior on a real render.

2. **Phone-width stacking, no horizontal scroll** (WINDOWS #8)
   **Test:** Narrow viewport to 375px; confirm item/batch fields stack vertically and no horizontal scrollbar appears.
   **Expected:** Holds true per the `@media (max-width: 599px)` rules already verified present.
   **Why human:** Rendered-viewport layout property.

3. **Button interactive states (focus ring, hover fade, disabled)** (WINDOWS #7)
   **Test:** Tab/hover/disable buttons in a live browser; confirm focus ring is visibly brown, hover darkens border without layout shift, disabled state greys out with not-allowed cursor.
   **Expected:** Holds true per the CSS rules already verified present.
   **Why human:** Perceptual/visual judgment of color and motion.

4. **Batch render order matches live server data**
   **Test:** Expand a multi-batch item against a live backend; confirm rendered order matches server response order.
   **Expected:** Holds true — no client-side `.sort()` exists (confirmed by grep).
   **Why human:** Requires comparing rendered output against actual live server data, not just absence-of-sort in the client.

### Gaps Summary

No gaps. Every artifact, wiring link, and cross-file contract this phase promised exists, is substantive, and is internally consistent — verified directly against source, not inferred from SUMMARY.md narrative. The two SUMMARY.md-documented deviations (Checkout.js line-wrapping to satisfy a literal-substring grep, and removing bold markdown from `05-DESIGN.md`'s `Data source:` lines) are cosmetic formatting choices made solely to satisfy the plans' own acceptance-criteria grep patterns — they change no meaning and were independently confirmed by direct read of both files. The one stale/out-of-scope acceptance criterion noted in 05-02's SUMMARY (`Checkout.js`'s `//` line-comment count, tripped by a pre-existing, unrelated 3-line comment inside `handleConsume` that predates this phase) was correctly not "fixed" by editing unrelated code outside the plan's stated scope — confirmed by reading `Checkout.js` directly; the pre-existing comment is unrelated to the `ItemActions` header block this phase converts to JSDoc.

The only open item is the deferred human-visual/perceptual pass (WINDOWS #6, #7, #8), which this project's own validation strategy (`05-VALIDATION.md`) scoped as manual-only from the start, for a class-project PoC with no visual-regression tooling. This is not a code or documentation defect — it is the expected next step in the phase's own designed workflow (`human_verify_mode: end-of-phase`). Given the strength of the underlying code-level evidence (correct CSS properties, correct class wiring, correct markup structure, a passing build, and zero anti-patterns), the risk that this human pass surfaces an actual defect is low, but it has not been executed and should not be waived silently. Recommend running the live-browser pass (or waiving WINDOWS #6/#7/#8 with an explicit reason if the team accepts code-level evidence as sufficient for this PoC's rubric) before treating Phase 5 as fully closed.
