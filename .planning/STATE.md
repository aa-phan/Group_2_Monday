# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-28)

**Core value:** A project member can see what hardware sets a project has, request/check out units they need, and check units back in — all from live shared data, with no hard-coded values anywhere in the app.
**Current focus:** Track A — Account & Project Management (Track B complete, reverted to generic hardware domain)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 — Account & Project Management
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-09-28 — domain reverted to generic HaaS/hardware-resource per assignment spec

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 25% (1/4 tracks complete)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap regenerated against the household food inventory domain (households = "projects", food item stock = "hardware resources"), replacing the earlier generic hardware-resource roadmap.
- Roadmap: Structured as 3 parallel tracks (Account/Household, Inventory, Data-API-Deployment) matching the codebase's existing module seams (`usersDatabase.py`, `hardwareDatabase.py`, `projectsDatabase.py`) so 3 developers can work with minimal cross-blocking.
- Roadmap: Track A and Track B both write to `projectsDatabase.py`'s household document — Track A owns household CRUD/membership (create household, join household, list a user's households), Track B owns item-quantity updates (reserve, consume/checkout, restock/check-in). Flagged as the one required coordination point between otherwise-independent tracks; agree on the item-stock schema (capacity/availability per item, keyed by location) before both write to it.
- Roadmap: Track C (data/API/deployment) depends on Track A and Track B for its integration-verification and deploy success criteria, but its infra sub-tasks (Mongo Atlas setup, deploy pipeline skeleton, PyTest harness) can start day one in parallel.
- Renamed the internal 3-part work-breakdown from "Phase 1/2/3" to "Track A/B/C" across planning docs (quick task 260914-g9c) to avoid colliding with the assignment PDF's own grading "Phase 1"/"Phase 2" milestones. "Phase" is now reserved exclusively for those two assignment-defined grading milestones.
- Restructured from 3 tracks to 4 tracks (quick task 260914-pzo) — the team confirmed it has 4 developers. Track C (which combined Data Integration & API with Deployment & Quality) split into Track C (Data Integration & API) and a new Track D (Deployment & Quality); US-12, TD-08, TD-09, TD-10 relabeled from Track C to Track D with no other change. Rubric item ownership locked: Track A owns R1-1 + R2-2, Track B owns R1-2 + R2-1, Track C owns R1-4 + a promoted stretch-feature scope (STRETCH-01/02, from 2 backlog items) instead of a numbered R2 item, Track D owns R1-3 + R2-3.
- **Track B (Inventory Management) complete** (2026-09-22) — 4/4 plans executed, code review found and fixed a Critical NoSQL-operator-injection vulnerability (CR-01), all 5 UAT tests passed against a real local MongoDB. Key decision: inventory lives in a separate `Items` collection, not embedded in the household document — removes the Track A/Track B write-contention risk the roadmap originally flagged. Track B's tracer plan also bootstrapped the React client and fixed Flask's broken imports, since the scaffold could not run at all before this — Track A and other tracks build into the same client shell rather than creating a new one.
- **Phase 05 (UI Design) complete — full live-browser UAT passed** (2026-09-24) — 05-01/05-02 executed and merged to `main` under the (now-reverted) food-inventory domain; design-token system, prop-contract conventions, and JSDoc discipline established there carry forward as still-valid process, but its domain-specific content is superseded by the 2026-09-28 pivot below.
- **Phase 06 (Dashboard Redesign) partially executed, then superseded by domain pivot** (2026-09-25 to 2026-09-28) — Wave 1's tracer task (table+modal dashboard layout) was committed against the food-inventory domain before the pivot below landed; its structural UI pattern (data table, shared Modal component, filter-driven view) was carried forward into the generic rebuild, but its food-specific content was replaced. `06-02`/`06-03` (palette finalization, docs) were not executed under the old domain — moot now.
- **Domain pivot: reverted food-inventory reframing back to the assignment's generic HaaS/hardware-resource domain** (2026-09-28) — user-directed scope change. Re-read `Team Project_Fa26.pdf` in full (SN0-SN6, SR1-SR5, Figure 2/3 mockups) and rewrote the project end-to-end to implement it directly rather than through a food-inventory analogy: `PROJECT.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md` (INV-*/HH-* IDs → RES-*/PROJ-*), `ROADMAP.md`, `WORK-ITEMS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE-SKETCH.md`, `PROJECT-PLAN.md` all rewritten (commit `483f275`); server (`hardwareDatabase.py` simplified to a flat `HardwareSets` model — capacity/available per named hardware set, no location/freshness/batches — `freshness.py` and `itemIdentity.py` deleted, 31/31 tests passing, commit `4e6522b`); client (`Project.js`→`ResourceView`/`HardwareTable`, `Checkout.js`→`HardwareActions`, `RestockForm.js`→`CheckinForm`, `FreshnessBadge.js`/`BatchList.js` deleted, build passing, commit `0db31b7`). Kept a lightweight non-binding "request" (reservation) concept mapping to SN3, distinct from checkout — independently converged on by three parallel work-streams (docs/server/client) without coordination, then hand-reconciled for one wire-format mismatch (server originally serialized `availability`/`reservations`/`reservationId`; renamed to `available`/`requests`/`requestId` to match the client and the assignment mockup's own "Available"/"Request" column labels — server commit follow-up, all 31 tests re-passing). GitHub Projects board renamed to "HaaS Resource Manager Board" and all 48 items updated to match (12 food-specific items archived), the visual board artifact republished to match, and local `main` merged with a teammate's bcrypt password-hashing work from `origin/main` (clean merge, 52/52 tests) and pushed.
- **Track D rescoped to remove mid-project idle time** (2026-09-28) — user flagged that Track D (Deployment & Quality) was structurally backloaded: thin Day-1 scaffolding, then real work (meaningful tests, actual deploy) gated on every other track finishing. Rebalanced across `PROJECT.md`/`REQUIREMENTS.md`/`ROADMAP.md`/`WORK-ITEMS.md`: added `TD-16` (CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions, genuine Day-1 work — runs PyTest + client build on every PR); reworded `TD-09` from a single end-of-project test-writing batch into incremental, per-track-paired coverage; moved `STRETCH-01` (password reset, `US-13`) from Track C to Track D as standalone feature work buildable once Track A's login exists. Track C's remaining stretch item `STRETCH-02`/`US-14` was also narrowed — the base hardware-set model already supports an arbitrary number of named sets (`RES-05`, shipped), so the redundant "arbitrary sets" framing was reworded to the real remaining gap: explicit hardware-set-type management (create/rename/deactivate without needing a checkin first). GitHub board and visual artifact both re-synced: `US-13` moved to Track D on the board, `US-14`/`TD-09` reworded, new `TD-16` card added, board's "new/changed" cards visually flagged in the artifact.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ⚠️ [Domain pivot, 2026-09-28] GitHub Projects board ("PantryTrack Board") not yet updated to match the generic domain — stories/board content still needs to be pushed there from the rewritten `WORK-ITEMS.md`.
- ⚠️ [Domain pivot, 2026-09-28] Local `main` is ahead of `origin/main` by this session's work and behind by a teammate's bcrypt password-hashing commits (PR #3, `siddharth_dev` branch) — needs a pull (merge) + push once this pivot settles. Non-conflicting (different files).
- The Phase 05 UI-review's unstyled-Retry-button finding no longer applies — `Project.js` was fully rewritten under the domain pivot.

(Prior discrepancy in v1 requirement count, noted against the earlier hardware-domain REQUIREMENTS.md, does not apply to the re-scoped document — its Coverage section and actual requirement list both total 17.)
